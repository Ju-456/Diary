# ✨ Welcome to Your Digital Journal ✨  

Have you ever thought about having your personal journal on your computer? Much more ergonomic and convenient, isn’t it?  
Of course, you might worry about your computer being hacked. But don’t worry! This isn’t just any personal journal—it’s a **secure personal journal** with musltiple built-in security features to protect data. You have 2 steps of protection : the **1st step** protects your account and **the 2nd** pages inside. 

**(Obviously, don't forget to change chmod 0777 to 0766 if you use it for your own personal)**

## 🎯 Project Purpose  

This project was created with two primary goals:  
1. To improve my skills in the C language and above all algorithm development.  
2. To provide a useful tool that helps you organize your thoughts securely and efficiently.  

Also, this journal also functions as a **secure and automated notebook**, perfect for a variety of use cases.
